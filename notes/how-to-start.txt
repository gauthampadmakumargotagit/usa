Notes-how to host a page
===========================
1. login to github (hub is a remote git server)
2. create a repo (a working space in the git server) by proviging a name like '50-states'
3. select the repo and got to setting from the links on the top
4. nav to 'Pages' from the left pane
5. On section 'Deploy from branch', select 'Main' and 'root' 
	-	root means the standard 'index.html' file will be right in the root folder.
	-	it is possible to move this to 'docs' folder. Option is only limited to 'root' or 'docs'
	-	moving to 'docs' will help to keep other artifacts like docs, tooling, etc outside of main source code
6. optional - if a custom domain is available (purchased from godaddy), it is possible to specify the mapping
7. press 'Save' -- wait for a minute or so, and github will provide a published site links

Example:
Your site is live at https://gauthampadmakumargotagit.github.io/50-states/
Last deployed by @gauthampadmakumargotagit gauthampadmakumargotagit 9 minutes ago

Notes-how to contribute (submit code)
=====================================
1. install a convenient git-client in the laptop (can use tortoize-git on top of normal git-client)
2. clone the repo url 'https://github.com/gauthampadmakumargotagit/50-states'
3. write up 'index.html' (a standard filename)
4. commit+push - code will go up the way to github server
5. github agents detect the change and will recompile(build) and publish(deploy)
6. page is publically viewable after this, as 'https://gauthampadmakumargotagit.github.io/50-states/'
